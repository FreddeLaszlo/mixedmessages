# Mixed Message

A random sentence generator. The generator may not make perfect sense, but then it was meant to be silly!

## How to launch
Open index.html in a browser.

## How to test the JavaScript
Either:
+ You will need to have node.js installed. In `mixedmessages.js` uncomment the `console.log` line(s) and run `node mixedmessages.js` at a command propmpt. Each time you run the file a new message is generated.
+ 
+ Open a debugger in your favourite browser, place a breakpoint at the `document.getElementById('generate').onclick` line. Watch what happens when you click the `Click to generate a random message!` button.
